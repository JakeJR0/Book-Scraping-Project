## Background

The program is designed to scrape from diffrent sites which stores information about books, this project was made to help me with getting real data for a project I am working on within my T-Level course. This project is still in development currently as it only is able to gather information from one site, but I am planning to add more sites in the future.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Program

## Further Development

- Add additional sites to scrape from.
- Add a better storage solution (Change from CSV to SQL).
